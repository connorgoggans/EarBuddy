# EarBuddy

Note - Earbuddy is now broken as of iOS 9 and Swift 2, I might attempt to fix it in the near future.

# Overview
Earbuddy was my project for VandyHacks Spring 2015 and my first attempt at app making and the Swift language.

# What it does
Earbuddy is an app designed to help warn of and prevent noise-related hearing damage.  Earbuddy monitors the sound levels
in the background and sends notifications if the environment becomes loud enought to pose a significant threat for hearing damage.  When a notification is sent, Earbuddy will also notify the user of the approximate amount of time before permanent hearing damage could set in.

# How it was built
Earbuddy was built using Swift and the Xcode IDE.  This was my first time coding in Xcode or Swift so the code is a bit lackluster, but I think it's solid nonetheless.
